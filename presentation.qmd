`Welcome!` In this session, I‚Äôll walk you through how I developed a project to `summarize health metrics` using `R` and `Quarto`, and how I published the results as an R package on `CRAN.`

> ‚ÄúAs a collaborator with the Global Burden of Disease study, I found myself collecting insights, methods, and visualizations on how we measure health and mortality. After the 2021 GBD round, I decided it was time to bring it all together‚Äîfor myself, for students, and for anyone interested in global health metrics.‚Äù
