# Summarizing Health Metrics: From Quarto to CRAN
### DSLC.io project-club April 2025 - second Saturday ðŸ“š

This repository contains the material of the project-club April 2025 session. In this session I'll talk about how I started summarizing all learning about Health Metrics as a IHME collaborator and wrap everything up in a book titled: **Health Metrics and the Spread of Infectious Diseases: Machine Learning Applications and Spatial Modelling with R**, and a package **{HMSIDwR}** then published on CRAN.
